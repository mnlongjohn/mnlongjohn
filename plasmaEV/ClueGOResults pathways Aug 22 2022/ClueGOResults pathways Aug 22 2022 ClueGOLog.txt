#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 12170 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 334 -> corresponding genes 334, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 165 (49.4%) -> 169 (50.6%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.

#Genes from all Clusters associated to 316 representative Terms and Pathways (after applying general selection criteria): 68 (20.36%)
